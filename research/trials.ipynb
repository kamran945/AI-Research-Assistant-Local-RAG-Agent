Because PH is closely associated with OHS, thoroughly evaluating its etiology is essential, and individualized treatments must be considered. We describe two patients with OHS exhibiting severe PH with pulmonary vascular resistance exceeding 5 Wood units; both were classified as Group 1 PH, i.e., pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Initially admitted to our hospital complaining of dyspnea, both patients commenced PAH therapies in addition to positive airway pressure therapy and diuretics, improving their hemodynamic status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity, and finally enabling their discharge. These findings suggest that PAH can coexist with OHS, and PAH therapies, introduced with careful consideration, may provide substantial benefits for select patients.'),\n",

The study objective was to quantify the preferences of patients for pacemaker features.\\nMETHODS: Patients with a de novo (ie, initial) pacemaker indication were recruited from 7 US sites to complete a Web-based discrete-choice experiment survey between May 11, 2022, and May 24, 2023. Patients chose between pairs of experimentally designed, hypothetical pacemakers that varied according to type (removable leadless, nonremovable leadless, or conventional transvenous); battery life (5, 8, 12, or 15 years); time since regulatory approval (2 or 10 years); discomfort for 6 months (none or discomfort); and complication risk and infection risk (1%, 5%, or 10%/20% for each). Patients' choice data were analyzed using random-parameter logit models and latent-class analysis.\\nRESULTS: Among 117 participants, the mean (SD) age was 67.3 (14.6) years, 94% were white, and 42% were female. On average, patients' survey responses revealed a preference for removable leadless pacemakers (β, 0.340; SE, 0.096) over both nonremovable leadless pacemakers (β, -0.310; SE, 0.131; =0.001) and conventional transvenous pacemakers (β, -0.030; SE, 0.119; =0.031). However, latent-class analysis revealed 2 distinct preference classes. One class preferred leadless pacemakers (50.5%), and the other class preferred conventional transvenous pacemakers (49.5%). The conventional pacemaker class prioritized pacemakers with 10 rather than 2 years since regulatory approval (<0.001), whereas the leadless pacemaker class was insensitive to years since regulatory approval (=0.83). Complication risks and infection risks were found to be the most influential. All else equal, patients would accept maximum risks of complications or infections ranging about 5% to 18% to receive their preferred pacemaker type.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Latent-class analysis revealed strong patient preferences for the type of pacemaker, with a nearly equal split between recent leadless pacemaker technology and conventional transvenous pacemakers.

In the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), we investigated whether plasma FXI level was associated with cardiovascular events and cardiac function.\\nMETHODS: ARIC was our primary analytic cohort. We included 4471 participants (median age, 75 years; 57% female; 17% Black) who attended visit 5 (2011-2013) with Somalogic-quantified plasma FXI levels and echocardiographic cardiac function. Prevalent HF and atrial fibrillation (AF) cases were defined as having HF or AF diagnosed at or before each participant's visit 5 exam date. Incident HF and AF events were ascertained through 2021. Associations were assessed using Cox, logistic, and linear regression models. Primary prospective associations were also validated in the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) using an orthogonal FXI assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).\\nRESULTS: At ARIC visit 5, there were 665 and 419 participants with prevalent HF and AF, respectively. During a median follow-up of 9 years, there were 580 and 788 incident HF and AF events, respectively. Lower FXI level was associated prospectively with higher incidence of HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36 [for each 1-unit decrement of log-transformed FXI level] [95% CI, 1.01-1.83]) but not incident AF, and cross-sectionally with increased odds of AF (odds ratio [OR], 1.96 [95% CI, 1.23-3.07]) but not HF. In age-stratified analyses, decreased FXI was associated with higher incidence of HF in participants ≥75 years of age (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.08-2.28]) but not <75 years of age (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.68-1.79]). The inverse FXI-HF association was validated in CHS (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.02-1.36]). At ARIC visit 5, lower FXI level was also associated with higher prevalence of diastolic dysfunction and worse E/A ratio, left atrial (LA) volume index, LA function, and left ventricular mass index, but not left ventricular ejection fraction or global longitudinal strain.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Decreased FXI level is associated with greater incidence of HF, especially in older adults. It is also associated with prevalent AF, worse diastolic function, worse LA function, and greater LA size.

The ability of S100A1 to recognize and modulate the activity of targets such as SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ATPase) and RyR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) in cardiomyocytes has mostly been ascribed to its hydrophobic C-terminal α-helix (residues 75-94). We hypothesized that a synthetic peptide consisting of residues 75 through 94 of S100A1 and an N-terminal solubilization tag (S100A1ct) could mimic the performance-enhancing effects of S100A1 and may be suitable as a peptide therapeutic to improve the function of diseased hearts.\\nMETHODS: We applied an integrative translational research pipeline ranging from in silico computational molecular modeling and in vitro biochemical molecular assays as well as isolated rodent and human cardiomyocyte performance assessments to in vivo safety and efficacy studies in small and large animal cardiac disease models.\\nRESULTS: We characterize S100A1ct as a cell-penetrating peptide with positive inotropic and antiarrhythmic properties in normal and failing myocardium in vitro and in vivo. This activity translates into improved contractile performance and survival in preclinical heart failure models with reduced ejection fraction after S100A1ct systemic administration. S100A1ct exerts a fast and sustained dose-dependent enhancement of cardiomyocyte Ca cycling and prevents β-adrenergic receptor-triggered Ca imbalances by targeting SERCA2a and RyR2 activity. In line with the S100A1ct-mediated enhancement of SERCA2a activity, modeling suggests an interaction of the peptide with the transmembrane segments of the sarcoplasmic Ca pump. Incorporation of a cardiomyocyte-targeting peptide tag into S100A1ct (cor-S100A1ct) further enhanced its biological and therapeutic potency in vitro and in vivo.\\nCONCLUSIONS: S100A1ct is a promising lead for the development of novel peptide-based therapeutics against heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.'),\n",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.'}, page_content='INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are considered a potential aid for smoking cessation. This study investigates the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the motivational properties of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and provides insights into their addictive potential and implications for smoking cessation.\\nMETHODS: The study included 47 daily e-cigarette users, the majority of whom were former smokers (n=43), and 28 nicotine-naïve participants as controls. Among the e-cigarette users, 32 individuals currently used e-cigarettes exclusively, while 15 also used tobacco cigarettes (dual users). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine anticipatory brain activation to reward-predictive stimuli for money, e-liquid, or tobacco cigarettes, as well as the instrumental response to obtain each reward.\\nRESULTS: Exclusive e-cigarette users demonstrated increased activation in limbic regions, e.g., the nucleus accumbens, during the anticipation of e-liquid and money over tobacco cigarettes. Prefrontal regions showed greater activation during the anticipation of money compared to e-liquid or tobacco cigarettes. Dual users showed greater activation for money compared to tobacco cigarettes in the hippocampal limbic system. No significant differences were observed in the anticipation of e-liquid and tobacco cigarettes among dual users.\\nCONCLUSION: E-cigarettes are perceived as equally rewarding as money, highlighting their addictive potential. Among exclusive e-cigarette users, money and e-liquid have stronger motivational properties than tobacco cigarettes (even among former smokers), suggesting that e-cigarettes may be an effective tool for tobacco cessation. The comparable appeal of e-liquid and tobacco cigarettes among dual users may suggest that a complete switch to e-cigarettes may be more effective for smoking cessation.\\nIMPLICATIONS: It is important to understand the motivational properties of e-cigarettes, particularly compared to traditional tobacco products. E-cigarettes with little or no addictive potential might not be effective as a substitute for tobacco cigarettes; however, a high addictive potential would, conversely, pose a risk to non-smokers. Our data suggest that e-cigarettes have a sufficiently high addictive potential to make them an attractive alternative for smokers, especially if they switch completely from tobacco to e-cigarettes.'),\n",

Secondly, for patients with AVSD-TOF, we compared staged (n\\u2009=\\u200916) versus primary (n\\u2009=\\u200924) repair by assessing the following: patient characteristics, progression of atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation, and time-related reoperation and survival.\\nRESULTS: Five-year survival was similar between matched AVSD-TOF and isolated AVSD groups (80% vs 81%, \\u2009=\\u2009.9). Compared with primary repair patients, staged patients had smaller pulmonary valve annulus Z-score measured at first presentation (-2.2 vs -2.9, \\u2009=\\u2009.006). All staged patients (12 Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunts, 3 right-ventricular-outflow-tract stents, 1 ductal stent) survived to complete repair. Freedom from AVSD-related reoperation five years post-AVSD-TOF repair was 57% after staged versus 90% after primary repair (\\u2009<\\u2009.05) and left AVV reoperations were the most frequent reintervention. Survival five years after AVSD-TOF repair was 80% (63% after staged vs 90% after primary repair; \\u2009=\\u2009.08).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing AVSD-TOF repair have similar survival compared with matched isolated AVSD patients. Although approximately half of AVSD-TOF patients had initial palliation and all survived to complete repair, staged repair patients had lower survival and a higher reintervention rate compared with primary repair patients. The decision to pursue staged versus primary repair for future babies with AVSD-TOF remains challenging and should be chosen based on individual circumstances.\"),\n",

Although lower-body strength and power are often emphasized, the role of upper-body strength, particularly shoulder strength, remains less explored. Given the importance of upper-body movements in activities such as heading, shooting, and defending, understanding the relationship between shoulder strength and soccer performance is crucial. Aims This study aimed to explore any possible correlation between isometric shoulder muscle strength (flexors and extensors) and sports performance (sprint and agility) and to evaluate whether isometric shoulder strength is associated with sports performance in university-level soccer players. Methods A total of 35 male amateur soccer players were recruited, who underwent demographic measurements such as age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), and were then subjected to isometric strength assessment of the shoulder flexors and extensors using a handheld dynamometer (HHD). Subsequently, the players' sprint and agility performances were recorded. Appropriate statistical tests were performed on the obtained data. Results The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between shoulder flexor strength and sprinting (r=-0.707, p<0.01) and between shoulder extensor strength and sprinting (r=-0.611, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between shoulder flexor strength and agility (r=-0.121, p=0.48) or between shoulder extensor strength and agility (r=-0.212, p=0.22). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that only shoulder flexor strength (β=-0.688, t=-2.651, p=0.01) was found to have statistically significant relationships with sprint performance, explaining 50% of the variance in sprint performance. Conclusions The present study found a negative bidirectional relationship between shoulder muscle strength and sprint performance. Shoulder flexor strength explained 50% of the variance in sprinting performance. This information is useful for physiotherapists, coaches, and trainers to focus on strengthening the shoulder musculature to improve performance.\"),\n",

Despite improvements in diagnostic techniques, delays in recognition and treatment are still common, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital arrival and to analyze delays in diagnosing and initiating treatment for patients with high and intermediate-to-high risk PE.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 23 patients with high and intermediate-to-high risk PE admitted to a tertiary hospital from January 2021 to December 2023. Patients with pre-existing heart or lung conditions, low-risk PE, or those without follow-up were excluded. Routine blood tests, D-dimer measurement, 2D echocardiography, and CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) were used to diagnose PE. Thrombolysis with streptokinase was administered in confirmed cases, and patient outcomes were monitored post-hospitalization.\\nRESULTS: The study included 23 patients, with a mean age of 47.1 years, 65% of whom were male. The most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (78%), followed by chest pain (13%) and syncope (9%). Elevated D-dimer levels were found in 96% of patients, and right ventricular overload was seen in all cases through echocardiography. CTPA confirmed PE in 91% of patients. Significant delays were observed in both hospital arrival and in-hospital diagnosis, with an average delay of more than seven hours before treatment began. Early diagnosis followed by thrombolysis led to favorable outcomes, while delayed diagnosis resulted in poorer outcomes, including residual symptoms and right ventricular dysfunction.\\nCONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and treatment of PE greatly enhance patient outcomes, especially with timely thrombolysis. Echocardiography should be utilized promptly in emergency settings to facilitate early treatment. Quick recognition of PE, particularly in patients with risk factors, is essential to reduce mortality and long-term complications.'),\n",

Nevertheless, the therapeutical guidelines and pharmacological possibilities have improved over the past years. Therefore, this contemporary study aimed to clarify the effect of AF on long-term mortality in patients with incident AMI.\\nMETHODS: This study included 2,313 patients aged 25-84 years with initial AMI that occurred from 2009 until 2017, documented within the population-based Augsburg Myocardial Infarction Registry. Patients were monitored from hospital admission, with a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years (interquartile range 4.4 years). Survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis were conducted to explore the relationship between AF and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.\\nRESULTS: Altogether, 156 individuals had AF on their admission ECG, while the remaining 2,157 presented with sinus rhythm (SR). Patients with AF were significantly older, more frequently had arterial hypertension, non-ST-segment elevation MI, worse kidney function, smaller AMIs, and were more often former and non-smokers. An increased long-term all-cause mortality was observed among the AF group. (AF patients 39.1%, SR group 16.7%), Upon multivariable adjustment, a HR of 1.40 (95% CI [1.05-1.87]; p=0.023) was calculated when comparing the AF with SR patients.\\nCONCLUSION: An independently increased risk of long-term mortality for patients with AF compared with patients with SR in case of incident AMI was identified. Therefore, AF should be considered as a serious risk factor in AMI patients, and must be treated aggressively to reduce mortality risk.'),\n",

Specifically, the review explores the incidence of PSs, identifies risk factors that may increase their likelihood and determines predictive factors to help anticipate their occurrence. By addressing these points, the study aimed to enhance the understanding and management of PSs in ICD patients.\\nMETHODS: This study reviewed central databases from their inception up to March 2024. The primary objective was to examine the occurrence of PSs in patients with ICDs. Data were gathered on patient demographics, incidence rates, and various risk factors and predictors that might affect the occurrence of PSs. Then, a detailed analysis of the collected data was conducted to identify significant associations between these risk factors, predictors and the incidence of PSs.\\nRESULTS: This review identified a significant association between prior ICD shocks, defibrillation threshold testing, the presence of depression and anxiety for the occurrence of PS in patients with ICDs. This underscores the importance of thoroughly evaluating and managing these factors to improve the care of individuals with ICDs.\\nCONCLUSION: PSs are often associated with various factors, such as previous shock therapy, defibrillation threshold testing, depression, anxiety and higher levels of education.
